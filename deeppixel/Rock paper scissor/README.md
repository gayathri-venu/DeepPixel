## Steps:
* Tarin the model using an appropriate dataset. Here,a mixed data set is used to provide variation to the model and to avoid over fitting .
I have created my own data set using python script and mixed it with the dataset available online. Here is the preview of images I have used.
* after training and testing the model ,save the model weights 
* Add model weights to the python script provided ```play_with_computer```.
* Run the file ensure that you have installed all the dependencies mentioned in ```requirements.txt```.
